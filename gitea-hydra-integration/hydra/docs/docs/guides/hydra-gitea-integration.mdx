title: Gitea Hydra integration
---

Gitea(self hosted Git service) has several OAuth2 related features. The relevant here is the possibility
to sign into Gitea with (almost) any OAuth2 provider, in this case ORY Hydra.
So, in this guide, we'll connect Gitea's oauth2-openid-connector to ORY Hydra. We'll
do that in a docker-based lab-environment in order to investigate the details
before you do something like this in production.

## Preparation

Even though we're mostly using ORY Hydra in a docker-container, having the
command-line-client available is quite useful. So please install ORY Hydra as
explained in the [installation-guide](../install). You'll also need
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

The [5-min-tutorial](../5min-tutorial) might be worth checking out upfront.
It'll a give a nice quick overview how OAuth2 is working within ORY Hydra with a
minimal example. We assume basic knowledge, here.

If you have not yet the source code of ORY Hydra, which we'll need for the
`docker-compose` yaml-files, clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ory/hydra.git
```

We will access GitLab via the url http://gitea.example.com. So we need to map
it to localhost. This is done by modifying the hosts-file. On an unixoid system
find this file in `/etc/hosts`, on windows, you should find it in
`c:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts`. Add this line:

```
127.0.0.1 gitea.example.com
```

As this POC will work with http instead of https, we need to whitelist the above
domain-name to allow unencrypted http traffic. So add the following switch to
the services.hydra.command-section in the hydrastart.yml around line 24 so that
the line looks like this:

```
    serve all --dangerous-allow-insecure-redirect-urls http://gitea.example.com:8000/users/auth/ORY_Hydra(whatever the name you give while registering oauth2 client in authsource)/callback
```

## Spin up the instances and logging in

Use this command to spinup the instances. This will show the logs on the
terminal and it will take some time.

```shell
docker-compose -f hydrastart.yml \
    -f hydrastart-postgres.yml   \
    up --build
```

After this suceeds, you can access the login page
[sign-in-page](http://localhost:8000/users/sign_in). Don't try to login, yet, we
have to create the client in ORY Hydra, first.

Note: we would like to use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost as a hostname during the configuration in hydra. 

## Creating the client in ORY Hydra

Depending on whether you've the hydra-binary available, you can use it directly
or the one in the docker-container.

```shell
$ hydra clients create \
    --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:4445 \
    --id gitea-client \
    --secret secret \
    --grant-types authorization_code,refresh_token \
    --response-types code,id_token \
    --scope openid,offline \
    --callbacks http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/oauth2/ORY_Hydra(auth source name you will create)/callback \
    --token-endpoint-auth-method client_secret_post
```

Note: you can also use http://gitea.example.com:8000/users/auth/ORY_Hydra/callback


or you can use the binary within the docker-container:

```shell script
$ docker-compose -f hydrastart.yml exec hydra \
    hydra clients create \
    --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:4445 \
    --id gitea-client \
    --secret secret \
    --grant-types authorization_code,refresh_token \
    --response-types code,id_token \
    --scope openid,offline \
    --callbacks http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/oauth2/ORY_Hydra(auth source name you will create)/callback \
    --token-endpoint-auth-method client_secret_post
```
After that you can bring up the server on which token user port is defined, check the workflow is running.

```shell script
$ docker-compose -f hydrastart.yml exec hydra \
    hydra token user \
    --client-id gitea-client \
    --client-secret secret \
    --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:4444/ \
    --port 5555 \
    --scope openid,offline
```

## OAuth2 Login

With the first access of your
[Gitea-instance](http://gitea.example.com:8000/), you will have to register admin user 
and before that in server configuration make sure you define Gitea Base URL(with 127.0.0.1:8000 in our case) access and Gitea HTTP Listen Port(8000 in our case) which we have defined here.

After that login with the registered admin user and go to the site administration 
where you will find the auth source panel, where you can register oauth2 and openid provider with the client-id(in our case gitea-client)
and with the secret(in our case secret), also discovery url (which will be http://127.0.0.1:4444/.well-known/openid-configuration ) 
you can hit this url in browser to check the work around with the api, here in our case gitea instance will be accessing the well-known discovery url,
so if we give 127.0.0.1 it will try to point its own localhost instead we should point to hydra's well-known api right!
so we will define hydra hostname(in our case hyda, check out the hydrastart.yml to cross check) instead of 127.0.0.1 and it will look like this http://hydra:4444/.well-known/openid-configuration

After registeringthe auth source, log out from the gitea and again go to the login page.
You should see a "OpenId" Login-button. Clicking it will
forward you to the hydra-consent-app where you can login with foo@bar.com/foobar
similiar to the 5-min-tutorial. After that you have to give consent to accessing
your defined scopes. Congratulations, doing that should redirect you directly to
your personal Gitea-page. You have logged into Gitea via ORY Hydra.

So now, let's look at the individual pieces and how all of them work together.

## Docker-setup

Gitea has some [documentation](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-with-docker//) about
how to use their docker-images. It has also an example for docker-compose. The
`hydrastart.yaml` file in the hydra directory doesn't contain 
surprising things about gitea instance:

Below is typical docker-compose, in our case it may differ slightly. check out the hydrastart.yml file

```yaml
version: "2"

networks:
  gitea:
    external: false

services:
  server:
    image: gitea/gitea:latest
    environment:
      - USER_UID=1000
      - USER_GID=1000
    restart: always
    networks:
      - gitea
    volumes:
      - ./gitea:/data
      - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "222:22"
```


## Gitea configuration - OAuth2-setup

as we earlier discussed, after docker-compose up, all the instances will be up and running state.
we have to set up gitea server by hitting its url as per said earlier. (define 127.0.0.1 as localhost and also define port)
after create the first user(by default admin) and do the rest configuration regarding auth source(as disscussed).

The biggest-source for errors is the clients-options-section. Here we'll specify
the details for the OAuth2 flow and where ORY Hydra is located. Two things are
extremely important to keep in your mind when looking at configurations which
are specifying some flow one way or another:

- Where is the DNS-name resolved? Sometimes it's on the users browser, sometimes
  on Gitea or on the hydra-side. Especially in our docker-based POC, it makes a
  huge difference!

- Cookies can only be written/read, if they are from the same domain. In that
  case "127.0.0.1". That would be a different domain than "localhost". Pay
  attention to that.

These two points in our mind, let's look at the three configurations:



Some remarks for creating the client. We have created the client like this. The
second command shows the created client:

```shell
$ hydra clients create \
    --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:4445 \
    --id gitea-client \
    --secret secret \
    --grant-types authorization_code,refresh_token \
    --response-types code,id_token \
    --scope openid,offline \
    --callbacks http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/oauth2/ORY_Hydra(auth source name you created)/callback \
    --token-endpoint-auth-method client_secret_post

$ hydra clients get hydra --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:4445
{
        "client_id": "gitea-client",
        "created_at": "2020-08-31T08:47:30.000Z",
        "grant_types": [
                "authorization_code",
                "refresh_token"
        ],
        "jwks": {},
        "metadata": {},
        "redirect_uris": [
                "http://gitea.example.com:8000/users/auth/ORY_Hydra/callback"
        ],
        "response_types": [
                "code",
                "id_token",
                ""
        ],
        "scope": "openid offline_access profile email",
        "subject_type": "public",
        "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_post",
        "updated_at": "2020-08-31T08:47:30.000Z",
        "userinfo_signed_response_alg": "none"
}
```

- The endpoint is not part of the configuration but it's a command-line-switch
  telling the hydra-binary to which hydra-instance to talk to
- `id` and `secret` has been specified before in the gitea-configuration (auth source section in site administartion)
- The callback needs to be resolvable on the users-browser. However, originally,
  the callback-url is created on the Gitea-side. In order to make that
  resolvable on the client.


## Conclusion

We've successfully integrated Gitea with ORY Hydra. Everything was done as
configuration. No code has been created nor has any application been
monkey-patched while following this guide (so far).


## Troubleshooting

### redirect uris does not match any of the registered oauth2 client's pre-registered redirect urls.

After trying to login you get a message like this:

The "redirect_uri" parameter does not match any of the OAuth 2.0 Client's pre-registered redirect urls.

Check the request in network field in inspect, and see where the request is going.
Make sure it should not get confused with the localhost and 127.0.0.1 
in our case we have defined 127.0.0.1 as localhost in gitea server configuration, right!
(by default it was written localhost).

### If you try to re-run the container, if gitea instance is keep on retsrating, make sure you delete the gitea directory which has been created once you run the instance first time.

The reason can be it may be using the old migrations. anyway before re-run, deleting that directory should work.

### error 500

Double check the configuartion or rerun the scenario.
